== Terminology

=== Variable Naming

You will find various interfaces that refer to 'keys' or 'uid' etc. Here are the general thoughts and intended conventions behind the vairious identifier name patterns.

{ [*_uid:string]: any } ::
    The field identifier represented by *.uid is a Firebase generated identifier. See link:./src/app/shared/firebase-generate-push-id.ts[]
{ [*_key:string]: any } ::
    The field identifier represented by *_key is a human string. For example, Roles and Permissions use their names as their identifier.
FooBarsMappings::
     A one to many mapping between `Foo` and `Bars`.
